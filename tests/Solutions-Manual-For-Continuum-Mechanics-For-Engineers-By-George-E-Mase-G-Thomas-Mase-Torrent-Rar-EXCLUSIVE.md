net-SNMP (formerly known as UCD-SNMP) is a protocol that enables the exchange of network management information among different hosts on a network. It is based on SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), which is a standard for monitoring and controlling various aspects of network performance and troubleshooting. net-SNMP version 4.1.1 for LynxOS is compatible with SNMPv2 and SNMPv3, which are the second and third versions of the protocol that offer enhanced security and functionality. It also supports MIBI and MIBII, which are two sets of data structures that define the objects that can be managed by SNMP. The net-SNMP architecture consists of three main components: Managed Devices, which are the network elements that have SNMP agents installed on them; Agents, which are the software modules that collect and provide information about the managed devices; and Network Management Stations (NMS), which are the applications that communicate with the agents and perform network management tasks. LynuxWorks support of net-SNMP is beneficial for embedded systems developers, as it provides them with a widely used and open source solution for network management. Unlike other proprietary SNMP implementations that are closed-source and may have licensing fees or compatibility issues, net-SNMP allows developers to leverage its existing features and community support to create more efficient and reliable embedded systems.

One of the advantages of net-SNMP is that it supports both IPv4 and IPv6, which are the two versions of the Internet Protocol that define how devices communicate over the network. IPv6 is the newer version that offers more address space and security features than IPv4, but not all devices and networks support it yet. net-SNMP allows developers to use either version or both, depending on their needs and preferences. net-SNMP also supports both TCP and UDP, which are the two protocols that define how data is transmitted over the network. TCP is more reliable but slower, while UDP is faster but less reliable. net-SNMP can use either protocol or both, depending on the type and importance of the data being exchanged.
  
Another advantage of net-SNMP is that it supports a variety of programming languages and platforms, which gives developers more flexibility and choice in creating their network management applications. net-SNMP provides libraries and tools for C, C++, Perl, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, and other languages. It also runs on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, BSD, and other operating systems. net-SNMP can be easily integrated with existing applications and frameworks that use SNMP or other network protocols. net-SNMP also provides a web interface and a command-line interface for accessing and manipulating SNMP data.
  
A third advantage of net-SNMP is that it supports a large number of MIBs and extensions, which expand the scope and functionality of SNMP. MIBs are collections of definitions and descriptions of the objects that can be managed by SNMP, such as network devices, interfaces, services, processes, etc. Extensions are additional modules that provide new features or capabilities for SNMP, such as encryption, authentication, logging, etc. net-SNMP supports many standard MIBs and extensions defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and other organizations. It also allows developers to create their own custom MIBs and extensions to suit their specific needs and requirements.
