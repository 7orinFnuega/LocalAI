In this article, we will show you how to download and install Cisco ASDM for ASA 5520, a firewall appliance that provides security and VPN services for your network.
 
## Step 1: Download Cisco ASDM Software
 
The first step is to download the Cisco ASDM software from the Cisco website. You will need a valid Cisco account and a service contract to access the software download page. You can use the following link to go directly to the download page for ASA 5520:
 
[https://software.cisco.com/download/home/280582808/type/280775065/release/9.1.7%20Interim](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/280582808/type/280775065/release/9.1.7%20Interim)
 
On this page, you will see a list of available software versions for ASA 5520. You can choose the latest version or the one that matches your ASA firmware version. For this example, we will use version 9.1.7 Interim.
 
Click on the download icon next to the software version you want to download. You may need to accept some terms and conditions before proceeding with the download. Save the file to your computer. The file name should be something like `asdm-791-153.bin`.
 
## Step 2: Upload Cisco ASDM Software to ASA 5520
 
The next step is to upload the Cisco ASDM software to your ASA 5520 device. You will need a console cable or a Telnet/SSH connection to access the ASA command-line interface (CLI). You will also need a TFTP server or a USB flash drive to transfer the file from your computer to the ASA.
 
For this example, we will use a TFTP server. Make sure your computer and the ASA are on the same network and can ping each other. Also, make sure your TFTP server is running and has the `asdm-791-153.bin` file in its root directory.
 
Connect to the ASA CLI using a console cable or a Telnet/SSH connection. Enter privileged mode by typing `enable` and entering your password. Then, enter global configuration mode by typing `configure terminal`.
 
To upload the Cisco ASDM software to the ASA, use the following command:
 `copy tftp:///asdm-791-153.bin disk0:/asdm-791-153.bin` 
Replace <tftp server="" ip="" address=""> with the actual IP address of your TFTP server. The command will copy the file from the TFTP server to the disk0: partition of the ASA flash memory. You may need to confirm some prompts during the process.</tftp>
 
After the file is successfully copied, you can verify its presence on the ASA flash memory by using the following command:
 `show disk0:` 
You should see something like this:

    -#- --length-- -----date/time------ path
       6 25088768    Sep 07 2016 14:00:32 asdm-791-153.bin
    255426560 bytes available (28753920 bytes used)

## Step 3: Configure ASA 5520 for Cisco ASDM Access
 
The final step is to configure your ASA 5520 device to allow web-based access using Cisco ASDM. You will need to enable HTTP server on the ASA, specify which interface and IP addresses can access Cisco ASDM, and specify which Cisco ASDM software file to use.
 
To enable HTTP server on the ASA, use the following command:
 `http server enable` 
To specify which interface and IP addresses can access Cisco ASDM, use the following command:
